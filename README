Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


Linux kernel installation experiment, just for fun
====================================================
- This source was forked from torvalds/linux, just for fun.
- The steps are captured with jupyter notebook, "experiment/*.ipynb"  
- Jupyter notebook configuration: jupyter + bash_kernel  
- Note:   
-- The jupyter with bash_kernel consumes lots of memory,  
-- so it would be better to perform the steps in the system shell terminal
