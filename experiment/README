# Linux kernel installation experiment, just for fun


- The steps are captured with jupyter notebook, "*.ipynb"
- Jupyter notebook configuration: jupyter + bash_kernel
- Note: 
-- The jupyter with bash_kernel consumes lots of memory,
-- so it would be better to perform the steps in the system shell terminal
